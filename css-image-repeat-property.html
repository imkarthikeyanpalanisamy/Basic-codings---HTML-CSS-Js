        <p>Mozilla has been fuzzing Firefox and its underlying components for a while. It has proven itself to be one of the most efficient ways to identify quality and security issues. In general, we apply fuzzing on different levels: there is fuzzing the browser as a whole but a significant amount of time is also spent on fuzzing isolated code (e.g. with libFuzzer) or even whole components such as the JS engine using separate shells with various fuzzers. For the purpose of this blog post, we will talk specifically about browser fuzzing only, and go into detail on the pipeline we’ve developed.The post Browser fuzzing at Mozilla appeared first on Mozilla Hacks - the Web developer blog.
